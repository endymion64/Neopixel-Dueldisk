# Neopixel-Dueldisk
Animating some Adafruit NeoPixel strips

This repository contains a small scripts to animate a bunch of short Adafruit NeoPixel strips which are embedded in the cosplay prop of my girlfriend. The prop is a replication of the [duel disk](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Duel_Disk#Duel_Disk_.28version_3.29) from the Yu-Gi-Oh! movie 'Dark Side of Dimensions':

The system consists of 6 LED-strips in star formation which are controlled by an [Adafruit Pro Trinket 5V/16MHz][trinketpro], running at 8 MHz.
The MCU clock speed has been manually reduced by changing the hardware settings used for compilation in the Arduino IDE. 
The MCU animates a gamma-corrected cosine wave over these strips in parallel:

The script is built on top of the [Adafruit NeoPixel library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) and was developed using the Arduino IDE.
